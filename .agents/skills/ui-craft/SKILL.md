description: The full lifecycle for user-facing surfaces — explore a screen as radically different grounded HTML mockups and lock a visual spec; implement a locked spec with fidelity evidence; critique a UI with heuristics and personas (including repo-specific personas); audit a live surface against its lock and for a11y/responsive/anti-pattern quality; run the pre-ship polish gate; or re-settle a locked term. Use when asked to design, mock up, redesign, build, critique, audit, polish, or verify any screen, dashboard, flow, component, or other UI. Not for backend-only work, and not for module/API design ("interface" in the code sense — use codebase-design for that).

# UI craft

One skill for the whole life of a user-facing surface: **lock** a visual spec,
**build** to it, **critique** it, **audit** it, **polish** it, **re-settle** it.
It replaces `ui-mockups`, `interface-craft`, and the absorbed parts of
`impeccable` (Apache-2.0, by Paul Bakaus — see the repo NOTICE).

Vocabulary guard: in the engineering charter, *interface* means a module's API.
This skill owns **surfaces** — rendered UI. If the request is about a Python
class, function signature, or module boundary, this is the wrong skill.

## Setup (every invocation)

1. Resolve this skill's installed directory as `UI_CRAFT_SKILL_DIR` (e.g.
   `~/.claude/skills/ui-craft`). Absorbed references may still say
   `IMPECCABLE_SKILL_DIR`; it is the same directory.
2. Run `node $UI_CRAFT_SKILL_DIR/scripts/context.mjs` once per session
   (`--target <path>` inside a monorepo). It prints PRODUCT.md / DESIGN.md or
   reports `NO_PRODUCT_MD` — in that case follow `reference/init.md` first.
   Ignore any `UPDATE_AVAILABLE` directive; this is a maintained fork.
3. Read the project's design system: tokens, theme, one representative
   component or page. Use what's there when it works.
4. Read the matching register reference: `reference/brand.md` when design IS
   the product (marketing, landing, portfolio), `reference/product.md` when
   design SERVES the product (app UI, dashboards, tools).
5. New project with no committed tokens: run
   `node $UI_CRAFT_SKILL_DIR/scripts/palette.mjs` for a brand seed.

## The lock is the contract

A surface that has been through `lock` has, next to its mockup:

- a `★ LOCKED` header in the mockup HTML, and
- a **lock manifest** — `mockups/<surface>.lock.md` — the checkable inventory
  every other mode reads. Format in `reference/lock.md`.

Rules that bind every mode:

- **No arbitration in private.** If two locked artifacts disagree, or a locked
  term collides with the app's shipped design system beyond what the
  manifest's precedence line settles, stop and ask. Implementer judgment never
  silently overrides a lock.
- **Deviation = re-settle.** Any build or refactor that changes a locked term
  goes through `re-settle` (dated, sanctioned, recorded) — never a quiet diff.
- **Evidence over green gates.** A surface is done when every manifest term
  has evidence, not when the test suite passes.

## Modes

Route on the first word (or obvious intent). Read the mode's reference before
acting — it defines the flow.

| Mode | Job | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lock [surface]` | Explore grounded variants, converge, lock spec + manifest | [reference/lock.md](reference/lock.md) |
| `build [surface]` | Implement a locked spec; ship the fidelity ledger | [reference/build.md](reference/build.md) |
| `critique [target]` | Heuristic scoring, slop verdict, persona walkthroughs | [reference/critique.md](reference/critique.md) |
| `audit [target]` | Technical checks (a11y, contrast, responsive, detector) + lock-fidelity audit when a manifest exists | [reference/audit.md](reference/audit.md) |
| `polish [target]` | Pre-ship quality gate; includes the manifest walk | [reference/polish.md](reference/polish.md) |
| `resettle [term]` | Amend a locked term with record-keeping | [reference/resettle.md](reference/resettle.md) |
| `init` / `document` | Project context setup / generate DESIGN.md | [reference/init.md](reference/init.md), [reference/document.md](reference/document.md) |

No argument: recommend the 1–3 most useful modes from context (unlocked
mockups → `lock`; open manifest without a ledger → `build`; never critiqued →
`critique`), then list the table. Never auto-run a mode.

General design invocations with no mode match (e.g. "make this less bland",
"fix the spacing") run under `critique`-then-fix using
[reference/design-rules.md](reference/design-rules.md).

## Design rules (all modes)

[reference/design-rules.md](reference/design-rules.md) carries the shared
craft discipline: the design-brief template, token-system-before-components,
typography/color/layout/motion rules, the absolute bans (side-stripes,
gradient text, default glassmorphism, hero-metric template, identical card
grids, eyebrow-on-every-section…), the AI-slop and category-reflex tests, and
the layered critique order. It is required reading for `lock`, `build`, and
any general invocation; the other modes consult it as needed.

## Personas

Persona walkthroughs live in `critique` (five built-in archetypes plus
project-specific ones). **Repo personas win:** if the repo has its own persona
definitions (a `.claude/qa/` directory, or a location named in its
CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md), use those personas — a diabetic user, a concerned
parent — instead of inventing equivalents, and follow the repo's sweep
protocol when one exists.

## Grounding rules (inherited from ui-mockups, apply everywhere)

- Ground every artifact in the app's real tokens, shipping UI/chart library
  at its shipping version, and real data shape from a **safe, manufactured
  fixture** — never production, personal, health, credential, or customer
  data.
- Vary the concept, not the decoration; three variants that differ only in
  color are one design.
- Inspect rendered output — source review alone never validates a visual
  artifact. Use `drive-local-webapp` for rendering; ask to install it if
  missing.
- Keep `mockups/INDEX.md` as the surface ledger (one row per surface:
  Surface / Concept / Status / Issue / File). `locked` rows are binding
  precedent; `shipped` rows defer to the app itself. Every mode that touches
  a lock updates the ledger in the same change — a stale ledger is a defect.
